## Project Brief
Build an app that retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as intractable items. It should be based on Labyrinth. Work in groups of three. 

## Project requirements 

- [x] Ideate, Design and create this project
- [x] Work with APIs, Redux and Thunks. 
- [x] Use redux to store the current state of the game.
- [x] Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay.
- [x] Use thunks to wrap your API calls.

# Running Locally

This is a short guide on how to run a Redux quiz project locally.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
- A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies including `react-redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, and `react-router-dom`.

## Running the Project

1. After the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the development server.
2. Once the server is started, you can view the project in your web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

That's it! You now have the Redux project up and running on your local machine with all the required dependencies installed.
